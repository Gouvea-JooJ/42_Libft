| Objectives
- Build a Personal Library: The primary objective is to create a custom C library that re-implements essential functions. This library can be reused in future projects, fostering the development of a robust codebase.
- Deepen C Knowledge: By coding these basic functions, students gain a deeper understanding of how C works at a low level, including how functions are constructed and optimized.
- Learn Best Practices: The project encourages students to learn and apply best practices in coding, such as writing clean, modular, and efficient code.
- Prepare for Future Projects: The "libft" serves as a foundation for more complex projects at 42, ensuring that students have a solid grasp of fundamental concepts and a reliable set of tools to build upon.

| Challenges
- Understanding C Programming: One of the primary challenges is mastering the intricacies of the C programming language, particularly in memory management, pointer arithmetic, and handling edge cases.
- Strict Coding Standards: The project enforces strict coding standards, which can be challenging for students who must adhere to specific norms for code formatting, naming conventions, and overall code structure.
- Testing and Debugging: Developing functions that must work seamlessly across various use cases requires extensive testing. Debugging errors in C, especially those related to memory allocation and pointer dereferencing, is notoriously challenging.
- No External Libraries: Students are required to build functions from scratch without relying on external libraries, which challenges them to implement and optimize common functionalities, such as string manipulation and memory handling.

| Learnings

- Critical Thinking: Students learn to approach problems methodically, breaking them down into smaller tasks and understanding how each function interacts with the others.
- Code Optimization: The project teaches the importance of writing efficient code, as students must consider performance implications, especially in memory and CPU usage.
- Problem-Solving Skills: Encountering and resolving bugs hones problem-solving skills, requiring patience and perseverance.
- Attention to Detail: The strict requirements instill a habit of paying close attention to details, which is crucial for avoiding errors and producing high-quality code.
